# üë© About Me
I‚Äôm currently a final-year Master student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), where I‚Äôm fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Min-Ling Zhang](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/zhangml/). I'm also advised by [Dr. Yi Gao](https://gaoyi439.github.io/).

My research interest includes multi-label learning, weakly-supervised learning. I am always open to potential collaborations or research opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me:
